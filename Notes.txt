apt-cacher:
Seems to work with systemctl start / stop
Web interface seems OK.
In principle, the ip address of the container can be used with APT_CACHER for ingo and other stuff.


apt-mirror:
Work with systemctl start
Does not work with systemctl stop
Log in inside to either:
- run apt-mirror script
- start the nginx service (service nginx start)
Still need to make it work with all the repo we are using...

apt-base:
Nothing to declare

apt-test:
Use to quickly test apt-update etc... to see if it responds


TODO:
1. Get apt-mirror to mirror all the sites we want correctly
2. Get apt-cacher to link on apt-mirror and use it as source
3. Find the conveniant way to run apt-mirror (maybe apt-mirror-update and apt-mirror-serve
